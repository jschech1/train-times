# Train Time Scheduler

## This app allows users to retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js by providing train arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

## The user will input the train name, destination, start time of the train, and its frequency. The form then produces data,  when the next arrival is and how many minutes that is. I used JavaScript to build this application's functionality. I also used Firebase for instituting data storage.
